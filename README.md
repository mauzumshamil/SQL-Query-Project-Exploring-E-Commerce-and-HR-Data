# SQL-Query-Project-Exploring-E-Commerce-and-HR-Data
Explore interconnected e-commerce and HR databases through SQL queries. Gain insights into sales, inventory, employees, and more for comprehensive data analysis.

SQL Query Project: Exploring E-Commerce and HR Data
====================================================

Overview
--------

This project aims to explore and analyze data from interconnected databases related to e-commerce operations and HR management. The databases consist of multiple schemas, including the following:

- `SQL_hr`: Includes tables for managing employee data, payroll, benefits, etc.
- `SQL_inventory`: Contains tables related to inventory management.
- `SQL_invoicing`: Includes tables for invoicing and billing processes.
- `SQL_store`: Contains tables related to e-commerce operations, such as customers, orders, products, and shippers.
- `sys`: System database containing metadata and information about the SQL Server instance.

Project Components
------------------

The project is composed of various components, each serving a specific purpose within the exploration and analysis of the data:

1. **Database Schema:**
    
    The database schemas provide the structure for organizing and storing the data. Key schemas include:

    - `SQL_hr`: Includes tables for managing employee data, payroll, benefits, etc.
    - `SQL_inventory`: Contains tables related to inventory management.
    - `SQL_invoicing`: Includes tables for invoicing and billing processes.
    - `SQL_store`: Contains tables related to e-commerce operations, such as customers, orders, products, and shippers.
    - `sys`: System database containing metadata and information about the SQL Server instance.

SQL Queries and Clauses
------------------------

These queries and clauses are utilized across the different scripts to explore, analyze, and manipulate the data within the interconnected databases.

*   **Data Retrieval Queries:** These queries retrieve specific information from tables within the databases.
*   **Data Analysis Queries:** These queries involve aggregations, calculations, and comparisons to gain insights into various aspects of the data.
*   **Data Transformation Queries:** These queries manipulate and transform the data to meet specific requirements.
*   **Data Management Queries:** These queries are used for managing the data within the databases.

Usage
-----

To run the SQL scripts and execute the queries:

1.  Ensure that you have access to the SQL Server or database management system where the databases are hosted.
2.  Open each SQL script file in your preferred SQL editor or query tool.
3.  Connect to the appropriate database server and schema.
4.  Execute each query individually or run the entire script to analyze the data.

Conclusion
----------

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of data from interconnected databases related to e-commerce and HR management. By running the SQL scripts and analyzing the results, users can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, sales performance, employee metrics, and more.
